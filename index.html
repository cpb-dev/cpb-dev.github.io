							<h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							The idea behind this website is to showcase a few of my projects and experiences, 
							as well as, 
							provide a bit of context into who I am.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently I have graduated from the University of Kent, achieving an MSc  in Artificial Intelligence. 
							Before this I had a BSc in Computing from Buckinghamshire New University, 
							where I felt I would be starting off as a developer for either android applications or websites. 
							However, over the last year within my MSc, 
							I have uncovered a newfound respect for data and how it can provide a useful narrative for every aspect in life. 
							Through both my degree and my own personal studies, 
							I have been passionate about how I could grow in the industry of data science and machine learning.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a person I am always up for a challenge where I can learn new skills or improve current ones. 
							I am a bit of a golfer, so much so, I was the Junior Captain of my local club, Moor Park. 
							Although it can be frustrating at times, 
							I like the drive and push that golf provides with the constant need to improve your game. 
							Off the course though, I have always enjoyed a relaxing day where I can kick back and play some games. 
							To name a few of my favourites; Zelda, Last of Us, Hades. 
							Where through puzzle solving and strategy, 
							you can overcome a challenge in a variety of different ways depending on skill and resource management.

								<h3>Producing Novel Music Using a Deep Neural Network</h3> <br />
								<p>
									This project was used as part of my AI MSc at the University of Kent for my final Dissertation. 
									With this project I wanted to comprise a dataset of different songs by various artists, 
									constructing a deep neural network that can find patterns and learn to produce songs of its own.
								</p> <br />
								<p>
									I used a variety of datasets for different types of music files, namely; WAV, MP3 and MIDI files.
									The technologies I used for the data collection and manipulation was Music21 and Librosa. When it
									came to the construction of the network I used a variety of libraries such as; TensorFlow, Keras,
									Pandas, NumPy and SkLearn.

								<h3>Using Reinforcement Learning to Play Tetris</h3> <br />
								<p>
									This was a group project as part of my Natural Computation module in my AI MSc. 
									For this project, I was elected team leader for a group of three, 
									where we had to use reinforcement learning techniques to produce an AI that could play Tetris.
								</p> <br />
								<p>
									For this project we used a range of Python libraries, such as; 
									PyGame, PyTorch, NumPy, MatPlotLib and tkinter. 
									We had to separate the project into a few different areas, 
									one for the building of the game board and mechanics, 
									one for the controlling and understanding of the game state, 
									and the final for the Neural Network that would be processing the game.
