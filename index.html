						</span>
						<p>
							I recently graduated from an Artificial Intelligence MSc at University of Kent,
							where I grew my interest and skill set within AI development.
							Since this I have been eager to keep improving my craft,
							working on a variety of projects within the areas of Data Engineering and Machine Learning.
							This website is for me to showcase some of the bigger projects I have worked on,
							as more of an extension to my CV. Although, almost all my projects can be found on either GitHub or Kaggle too.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am eager to advance into the industry and to work on projects that have a real world impact.
							I am a problem solver at heart, so put my all into my work to ensure I accomplish what I set out to achieve.
							I work mainly in Python at the moment, with a minor history in web development.
							However, I am easily adaptable and a keen learner,
							so would be interested to expand my existing knowledge depending on the task at hand.

							I am currently getting into the idea of blogging my journey within the industry on Instagram,
							Where I talk about my learning and the projects I'm working on.

								Other than that, I am also a gamer, golfer, reader, music lover and Netflix binger. 
								I have just finished playing God of War, while also playing/moving onto; 
								Hades, Uncharted: Lost Legacy, and the occasional Bloodborne. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I am a huge music listener, being mainly into alternative rock and hip-hop. 
								Being a big gig and festival lover I have seen quite a few acts, such as; 
								Gorillaz, Arctic Monkeys, Circa Waves, Tyler the Creator, Loyle Carnerâ€¦ the list goes on. 
								It is a bit of a passion of mine, so much so, I based my MSc final year project around music 
								(which you can see in the projects list below).

								With golf, I try to play as much as possible. 
								Since university, however, it has been increasingly difficult to get out. 
								With a handicap of 18, my game could do with a bit of improvement though.

								<h3>Producing Novel Music Using a Deep Neural Network</h3>
								<div style="text-align: center;">
									<h5>Languages: Python</h5>
									<h5>
										Data Types: 
										<span id="dnn_Data"></span>
										<div class='console-underscore' id='console'>&#95;</div>
									</h5>
									<h5>
										Libraries: 
										<span id="dnn_Libraries"></span>
										<div class='console-underscore' id='console'>&#95;</div>
									</h5>
								</div><br />
								<p>
									This project was used as part of my AI MSc at the University of Kent for my final Dissertation.
									With this project, I wanted to comprise a dataset of different songs by various artists,
									constructing a deep neural network that can find patterns and learn to produce songs of its own.
								</p> 
								<!-- Hide content from this point (until expanded)-->
								<div id="hideDNN" style="display: none;"> <br /> 
									<p>
										Within this project I had to collect different sets of music data, comprising of MP3, WAV and MIDI files. 
										I stored these files locally with relevant tagging that can be easily interpreted by the Neural Network 
										I was going to feed this information through. 
										First I needed to analyse the different formats to see what patterns could be identifiable and 
										how they would be relevant to the reproduction of a new music sound file. Upon analysis the best dataset 
										turned out to be with MIDI files, due to their easily interpretable nature, it made reproducing data possible. 
										The other formats were still able to identify patterns, however, only white noise could be made when reproducing the data. 
									</p> <br />
									<p>
										Creating a Convolutional Neural Network with the use of TensorFlow and Kera's, 
										I was able to analyse a test and validation set of MIDI files to reproduce musical data. 
										This data was very rudimentary and although it resembled that of the original data, 
										there was still some kinks that could be worked out. 
									</p> <br />
									<p>
										Overall this was a fun and interesting project, 
										where I got to work with a range of different data collection and analysis techniques as well as ML.

								<h3>Using Reinforcement Learning to Create an Agent that Can Play Tetris</h3>

								<p>
									This was a group project as part of my Natural Computation module in my AI MSc.
									For this project, I was elected team leader for a group of three,
									where we had to use reinforcement learning techniques to produce an AI that could play Tetris.
								</p>
								<div id="hideTetris" style="display: none;"> <br />
									<p>
										For this project we used a range of Python libraries, such as;
										PyGame, PyTorch, NumPy, MatPlotLib and tkinter.
										We had to separate the project into a few different areas,
										one for the building of the game board and mechanics,
										one for the controlling and understanding of the game state,
										and the final for the Neural Network that would be processing the game.

								<h3>Making an Automated Smart Desk Using Arduino and Alexa</h3>

								</div><br />
								<p>This was a fun little project I did for my IOT module as part of my MSc in AI.
									In this project I used an Arduino and an Alexa to automate my desk set-up.
								</p> 
								<div id="hideSmartDesk" style="display: none;"> <br />
									<p>
										The idea of the project was to run an Alexa routine as the presence of a
										person is detected by the Arduino. This would be fully customisable by the user,
										however, it would essentially get the mood right as a user is sat at their desk for work.
